Chase brings with him a dire warning: Moriarty's death has left a convenient vacancy in London's criminal underworld. There is no shortage of candidates to take his place—including one particularly fiendish criminal mastermind.<br /><br />Chase is assisted by Inspector Athelney Jones, a Scotland Yard detective and devoted student of Holmes's methods of deduction, whom Conan Doyle introduced in <em>The Sign of Four</em>. The two men join forces and fight their way through the sinuous streets of Victorian London—from the elegant squares of Mayfair to the shadowy wharfs and alleyways of the Docks—in pursuit of this sinister figure, a man much feared but seldom seen, who is determined to stake his claim as Moriarty's successor.<br /><br />Riveting and deeply atmospheric, <em>Moriarty</em> is the first Sherlock Holmes novel sanctioned by the author's estate since Horowitz's <em>House of Silk</em>. This tale of murder and menace breathes life into Holmes's fascinating world, again proving that once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however im- probable, must be the truth.","author":{"id":"32590","name":"Anthony Horowitz","role":"","image_url":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1301176549p5/32590.jpg\n","small_image_url":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1301176549p2/32590.jpg\n","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32590.Anthony_Horowitz","average_rating":"4.05","ratings_count":"748147","text_reviews_count":"47474"},"published":"2014"},"rating":"0","votes":"0","spoiler_flag":"false","spoilers_state":"none","shelves":[{"exclusive":"true","id":"162023098","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1564458973","sortable":"true"}],"recommended_for":"","recommended_by":"","started_at":"","read_at":"","date_added":"Wed Feb 08 23:07:54 -0800 2017","date_updated":"Wed Feb 08 23:07:54 -0800 2017","read_count":"0","body":"\n  ","comments_count":"0","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1907677487","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1907677487","owned":"0"},{"id":"1854145592","book":{"id":452235,"isbn":"044021145X","isbn13":"9780440211457","text_reviews_count":694,"title":"The Firm","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1598787562l/452235._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1598787562l/452235._SY75_.jpg","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/452235.The_Firm","num_pages":"501","format":"Mass Market Paperback","publisher":"Dell","publication_day":"11","publication_year":"1999","publication_month":"11","average_rating":"4.09","ratings_count":"41859","description":"At the top of his class at Harvard Law, he had his choice of the best in America.

Does <i>The Appeal</i> make the grade? And will it appeal to Grisham admirers -- or disappoint them?<p>The stakes in the novel's plot are high: corporate crime on the largest scale. The duo of lawyers at the centre of the narrative are Mary and Wes Grace, who succeed in a multimillion dollar case against a chemical company, who have polluted a town with dumped toxic waste. A slew of agonising deaths have followed this, but lawyers for the chemical company appeal, and a variety of legal shenanigans are employed -- and it is certainly not clear which way the scales of justice will be finally balanced.</p><p>As ever with Grisham, the mechanics of plotting are key, and the characterisation is functional rather than detailed. But it is (as always) more than capable of keeping the reader totally engaged. Given John Grisham's much-publicised conversion to born-again Christianity, it's intriguing to note here the implicit criticism of the moral majority's religious values, but that is hardly central to the enterprise. What counts is the storytelling, and while the writing is as straightforward and uncomplicated as ever, few readers will put down <i>The Appeal</i> once they have allowed it to exert its grip on upon them. --<i>Barry Forshaw</i></p>","author":{"id":"721","name":"John Grisham","role":"","image_url":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1583932591p5/721.jpg\n","small_image_url":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1583932591p2/721.jpg\n","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/721.John_Grisham","average_rating":"3.91","ratings_count":"4825822","text_reviews_count":"166882"},"published":"2008"},"rating":"0","votes":"0","spoiler_flag":"false","spoilers_state":"none","shelves":[{"exclusive":"false","id":"206156441","name":"john-grisham","review_shelf_id":"1514207353","sortable":"false"},{"exclusive":"true","id":"162023099","name":"currently-reading","review_shelf_id":"1514207309","sortable":"false"}],"recommended_for":"","recommended_by":"","started_at":"Wed Dec 28 11:16:09 -0800 2016","read_at":"","date_added":"Wed Dec 28 11:16:09 -0800 2016","date_updated":"Wed Dec 28 11:16:12 -0800 2016","read_count":"1","body":"\n  ","comments_count":"0","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1854144738","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1854144738","owned":"0"},{"id":"1854144320","book":{"id":3613997,"isbn":"0385517831","isbn13":"9780385517836","text_reviews_count":3497,"title":"The Associate","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3613997-the-associate","num_pages":"373","format":"Hardcover","publisher":"Doubleday Books","publication_day":"27","publication_year":"2009","publication_month":"1","average_rating":"3.66","ratings_count":"61672","description":"<b>If you thought Mitch McDeere was in trouble in <i>The Firm</i>, wait<br />until you meet Kyle McAvoy, <i>The Associate</i> </b><br /><br />Kyle McAvoy grew up in his father's small-town law office in York, Pennsylvania.

They are, of course, none of these things. What they are is a two-bit operation always in search of their big break, ambulance chasers who’ve been in the trenches much too long making way too little. Their specialties, so to speak, are quickie divorces and DUIs, with the occasional jackpot of an actual car wreck thrown in. After twenty plus years together, Oscar Finley and Wally Figg bicker like an old married couple but somehow continue to scratch out a half-decent living from their seedy bungalow offices in southwest Chicago.<br /> <br />And then change comes their way. More accurately, it stumbles in. David Zinc, a young but already burned-out attorney, walks away from his fast-track career at a fancy downtown firm, goes on a serious bender, and finds himself literally at the doorstep of our boutique firm. Once David sobers up and comes to grips with the fact that he’s suddenly unemployed, any job—even one with Finley &amp; Figg—looks okay to him. <br /><br />With their new associate on board, F&amp;F is ready to tackle a really big case, a case that could make the partners rich without requiring them to actually practice much law. An extremely popular drug, Krayoxx, the number one cholesterol reducer for the dangerously overweight, produced by Varrick Labs, a giant pharmaceutical company with annual sales of $25 billion, has recently come under fire after several patients taking it have suffered heart attacks. Wally smells money.<br /> <br />A little online research confirms Wally’s suspicions—a huge plaintiffs’ firm in Florida is putting together a class action suit against Varrick. All Finley &amp; Figg has to do is find a handful of people who have had heart attacks while taking Krayoxx, convince them to become clients, join the class action, and ride along to fame and fortune. With any luck, they won’t even have to enter a courtroom! <br /><br />It almost seems too good to be true. <br /><br />And it is.<br /> <br />The Litigators is a tremendously entertaining romp, filled with the kind of courtroom strategies, theatrics, and suspense that have made John Grisham America’s favorite storyteller.","author":{"id":"721","name":"John Grisham","role":"","image_url":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1583932591p5/721.jpg\n","small_image_url":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1583932591p2/721.jpg\n","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/721.John_Grisham","average_rating":"3.91","ratings_count":"4825822","text_reviews_count":"166882"},"published":"2011"},"rating":"0","votes":"0","spoiler_flag":"false","spoilers_state":"none","shelves":[{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"162023100","review_shelf_id":""},{"exclusive":"false","id":"206156441","name":"john-grisham","review_shelf_id":"1514206684","sortable":"false"}],"recommended_for":"","recommended_by":"","started_at":"","read_at":"","date_added":"Wed Dec 28 11:15:31 -0800 2016","date_updated":"Wed Dec 28 11:15:36 -0800 2016","read_count":"1","body":"\n  ","comments_count":"0","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1854143982","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1854143982","owned":"0"},{"id":"1854143417","book":{"id":5350,"isbn":"0385339100","isbn13":"9780385339100","text_reviews_count":2064,"title":"The Partner","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5350.The_Partner","num_pages":"416","format":"Paperback","publisher":"Delta","publication_day":"26","publication_year":"2005","publication_month":"4","average_rating":"3.93","ratings_count":"111312","description":"They watched Danilo Silva for days before they finally grabbed him.

Their son, Donny Ray, is dying of leukemia, and their insurance company has flatly refused to pay for his medical treatments. While Rudy is at first skeptical, he soon realizes that the Blacks really have been shockingly mistreated by the huge company, and that he just may have stumbled upon one of the largest insurance frauds anyone's ever seen -- and one of the most lucrative and important cases in the history of civil litigation.

No time for a conscience.<br /><br />But a violent encounter with a homeless man stopped him cold. Michael survived; his assailant did not. Who was this man?

In it, Victor Hugo takes readers deep into the Parisian underworld, immerses them in a battle between good and evil, and carries them to the barricades during the uprising of 1832 with a breathtaking realism that is unsurpassed in modern prose. Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Thénardier, and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds. Les Misérables gave Victor Hugo a canvas upon which he portrayed his criticism of the French political and judicial systems, but the portrait that resulted is larger than life, epic in scope—an extravagant spectacle that dazzles the senses even as it touches the heart.","author":{"id":"13661","name":"Victor Hugo","role":"","image_url":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1415946858p5/13661.jpg\n","small_image_url":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1415946858p2/13661.jpg\n","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13661.Victor_Hugo","average_rating":"4.14","ratings_count":"935451","text_reviews_count":"27930"},"published":"1987"},"rating":"4","votes":"0","spoiler_flag":"false","spoilers_state":"none","shelves":[{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"162023100","review_shelf_id":""}],"recommended_for":"","recommended_by":"","started_at":"","read_at":"","date_added":"Tue Dec 08 01:39:34 -0800 2015","date_updated":"Tue Dec 08 01:39:38 -0800 2015","read_count":"1","body":"\n  ","comments_count":"0","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1463175584","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1463175584","owned":"0"}],"total":14}
